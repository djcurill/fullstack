# Introduction to CSS

Go through MDN's [Intro to CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics) tutorial
to learn the basics of CSS. This exercise does not require any proof of completion. The `index.html` and `styles.css` file were used as a sandbox / learning environment to play around with content provided by MDN.

# Notes

- When you specify padding using 4 arguments such `padding: 10, 5, 3, 2` it will apply padding in order of top, right, bottom and left.
- `auto` is a special value that divides the available horizontal space evenly between left and right. This can be used to center material.
- Browsers apply a default margin at the top of the page to enhance readability of unformatted html
