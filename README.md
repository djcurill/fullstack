# Full Stack Curriculum

Repository for submitting exercises to complete the full stack curriculum offered by the University of Helsinki. To view more about this curriculum, check out their [intro page](https://fullstackopen.com/en/).

# Structure

---

This repo is organized such that each top level directory is a section of the course. Each
subdirectory contains the solutions to exercises for that section.
Each subfolder will have a README.md file that describes the exercise. If that did not make any sense,
see the directory tree structure below:

```
fullstack

    part0-<name of section>/
        ex0.1-<name-of-exercise>
            README.md
            src/

    part1-<name of section>/
        ex1.1-<name of exercise>/
            README.md
            src/

// And so on...
```
